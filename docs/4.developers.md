## Unit testing with Mocha.js

Execute all tests from the project's directory.

```bash
npm run test
```

Selective execution.

```bash
npx mocha ./test/source.js
```

## Versioning and publishing

New versions are managed by Lerna. The `npm version` script is available.

```bash
npm run version
npm run version patch
npm run version prerelease
```

Publishing is automatically trigged with versioning by push the latest tags into the publish GitHUb action.

## Unit testing with node:test (legacy, for reference)

Support for "node:test" has been removed in favor of Mocha.js. The motivation to switch to Mocha.js is that we haven't find a nice way to visualize errors. This section is left for future usage in case we find a way to improve error reports.

Tests are almost compatible using the Node.js native Test Runner package](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html). Support can be reactivated with only one change which involves adding the `import { describe, it } from 'node:test'` in the top of each test module.

Execute all tests from the project's directory.

```bash
node --test \
  `# Use a specific reporter, optional` \
  --test-reporter spec
```

Selective execution.

```bash
node --test \
  `# Use a specific reporter, optional` \
  --test-reporter spec \
  ./test/source.js
```

Advanced usage with multiple reporter and destinations.

```bash
node --test \
  `# Use a specific reporter, optional` \
  --test-reporter spec \
  --test-reporter dat \
  `# Destination for the corresponding test reporter` \
  --test-reporter-destination=stdout \
  --test-reporter-destination=file.txt
```
