# Dataset model

The dataset is organized by collections. Inside a collection are stored documents which may be organized hierarchically.

## Discovery

The engine is initialized with one or multiple plugins defining where and how to source collections and their documents.

The same collection may be sourced from multiple plugins. The plugin is in charge of discovering documents and returning the `collection` attribute for each document.

Consider the following layout:

```
+ plugin-1                          + store
  + authors                           + collection
    | gollum.md                         | document
  + articles                          + collection
    | a-blog-article.md                 | document
+ plugin-2                          + store
  + authors                           + collection
    | bilbo.md                          | document
  + pages                             + collection
    | a-website-page.md                 | document
```

The engine is created with 2 plugins. In the example, we assume that each plugin sources document from two collocated folders but plugins may choose to source document as they wish. Both plugins contain the author collection. When sourced, all authors are available:

```js
const authors = await engine([
  {
    module: 'redac/plugins/mdx',
    config: './plugin-1',
    uber: true,
  },
  {
    module: 'redac/plugins/mdx',
    config: './plugin-2',
    uber: true,
  },
])
  .from('authors')
  .map((document) => {
    slug: document.slug
  })
  .list()
assert.deepEqual(authors, [
  {
    slug: ['bilbo'],
  },
  {
    slug: ['gollum'],
  },
])
```
